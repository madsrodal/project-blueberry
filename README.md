```
A blueberry that jumps around,
From platform to platform, it's found,
Leaving a trail of jam behind,
A sweet and sticky path to remind.

It bounces high and rolls around,
A blueberry that's never bound,
It's free to roam and free to play,
A berry that's happy all day.

Its color is a vibrant hue,
A shade of blue that's bright and true,
It's plump and juicy, oh so sweet,
A berry that's hard to beat.

As it jumps from place to place,
It leaves behind a tasty trace,
A trail of jam that's oh so fine,
A treat that's simply divine.

So if you see a blueberry jump,
Don't be afraid, don't be a grump,
Just follow it and you will find,
A trail of jam that's one of a kind.
